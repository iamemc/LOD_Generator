ABOUT
---------------

> This Blender addon allows the automatic generation of LODs - Level of Detail meshes.
>
> > In [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics), **level of detail** (**LOD**) refers to the complexity of a [3D model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_model) representation.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics)#cite_note-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics)#cite_note-2)[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics)#cite_note-3) LOD can be decreased as the model moves away from the viewer or  according to other metrics such as object importance, viewpoint-relative speed or position. LOD techniques increase the efficiency of [rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)) by decreasing the workload on [graphics pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_pipeline) stages, usually [vertex transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_transformations). The reduced visual quality of the model is often unnoticed because of  the small effect on object appearance when distant or moving fast.
